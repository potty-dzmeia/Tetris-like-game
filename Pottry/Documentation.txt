Here's the description of the game.

There are two building blocks(Tetramino/PLayGround) of the game:

1. The TETRAMINO(class)
   
   a)This object is used only when we have a moving Tetramino.
     Once the Tetramino STOPS it's deleted. But before destroying it,
     we write what part of the playground it occupies and what is the type of
     it's blocks. All that information goes into PlayGround [][] structure.
   
     Example: Tetramino stops at some place.
	  	for(int i=0;i<4;i++)	//write the 4 blocks into the PG
			PG[begins_atX+blocks[i].x][begins_atY+blocks[i].y].state=1;
		//(Thats done in the Tetramino class)
		
		//write the current DIrectDraw Surface of the tetramino into the PG[][].surface
		//(That's also done in the Tetramino object(class))
     After all the information is written we are free to delete the tetramino object.
	
	b)Possible operations are:
		-move down
		(may issue a stop command- return 0;)
		-move left
		-move right
	    -rotate


2. And the PLAYGROUND(structure)
	
   a)This Structure holds all the information for the blocks that have stopped.
   After the tetramino stops all the needed information is transferred to this
   structure. 
   
   b)The possible operation on this structure are:
	-delete blocks
	-move down block
	(All this is needed when a line is dropped.)
	
   c)Drawing the block in the PlayGround
	 The block in the PG are drawn very simple.
	 for(every PG[]][].state ==(1))
			draw(PG[][].lpddSurface)



3. The Score:

	The score is calculated with the following formula:
	dwCurrentScore+=(iLinesDeleted*iLinesDeleted*200000)/(GetTickCount()-iLastLineDroppedAt+1)
	
	where:
	-iLinesDeleted are the last deleted lines
	-iLastLineDroppedAt the interval in milliseconds since a line was dropped
	
	Only the three top scores are saved.
    The score board is held into the SCOREBOARD structure
